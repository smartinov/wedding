Ten days before the scheduled celebration, the friend of the future bride and groom Nada ArsenoviÄ‡ surprised the newlyweds with a colorful drawing of the two of them! 
The drawing is done in an extremely original style, in bright and cheerful colors. 
On it, we can see Stefan, in a wedding suit and with a bow around his neck, riding a bicycle. 
Darija is sitting on the puck with a broad smile, holding a bouqueut made of pink roses. 
Attached to the bike are several small cans with hearts that symbolize a couple that has just married. 
Next to Stefan is the little grumpy Noah, their cat, wearing a bowtie for the wedding. 
Next to Darija wecan see a cute owl with a bow on its head - it looks fully ready to celebrate love! 
Behind them we can recognize the famous Charles Bridge in Prague, as well as buildings of a specific architectural style that point to the Czech capital, where the proposal took place. 
A particularly nice detail is the pink plane with hearts behind them, which carries the message "soon married". It fits perfectly into a cheerful wedding theme. 
This extremely original gift delighted Darija and Stefan, and hopefully the visitors of the site share the same impression! Congratulations on your creativity and talent, Nada!
