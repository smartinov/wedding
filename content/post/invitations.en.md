 They have finally arrived â€“ the invitations chosen with a lot of love and attention to detail! There are Serbian and English versions and both are written in verse! 
 Although there is also an electronic version, the majority of guests will have their in invitations handed in person because they are really beautiful!
 P.S. Pay attention to the little owls at the top of the invitation - they have been chosen as a symbol of love among the future newlyweds!
