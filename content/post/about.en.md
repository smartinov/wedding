### The first date

Darija and Stefan had their first date in a cafe that no longer exists - it was called "Owl cafe" and it was located in Laza Telečkog Street. 
As they really liked the place, and since they are both fans of owls, those little animals became their trademark. 
Their first date lasted over 3 hours and they really liked each other. 
It is especially endearing that at times they said literally the same sentence at the same time! 
The sympathies were mutual so they scheduled another date and the rest is history…

### The proposal

{{< figure src="/images/visegrad.jpg" title="Višehrad" >}}

The proposal took place one day before their second anniversary in a very beautiful and historically significant part of Prague called Visegrad. 
Everything was organized so that the future bride did not suspect what was about to happen, a parental blessing was previously received, and mutual friends were involved in the planning… 
the proposal took place at night, on the lookout point from where one can see the whole city. 
It all happened in a very romantic way - the future groom said everything he wanted and then he knelt holding a diamond ring to properly seal the proposal… 
As Darija said “yes” bunch of confetti flew in the air... they celebrated with champagne and there is a spontaneous and extremely nice video about everything!
