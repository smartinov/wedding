A few days before the wedding, the wedding rings arrived – elegant, classy, and made of white gold of excellent fineness. 
The future bride opted for the Burme Eternity Nº22 model with 18 diamonds, while the groom chose the same model with a simple line in the middle, which matches his style extremely nicely. 
These so called „anatomical wedding rings“ of the highest quality are specially adapted to the shape of the finger of the person who wears them.

The newlyweds chose to buy their rings at AS jewelry store because they liked their professionalism and helpful attitude towards the client. 
This jewelry store is known in Novi Sad for the quality of alloys, top jewelry, high-quality installation of precious stones and modern production. 
As this was the jewelry store where Stefan found the perfect engagement ring, Darija and he had a feeling that they would find perfect wedding rings there as well. 
And they were right!
