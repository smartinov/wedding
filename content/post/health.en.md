At the end of June 2020, reports began on an increased number of cases of corona disease in Serbia. 
The plague that we hoped to see back unfortunately returned in the summer months, when, according to the forecasts of experts, it should not have been expected.

There is no data that there is a large number of patients in Novi Sad and Vojvodina. 
The situation in the north of Serbia seems to be much better than in other parts of Serbia. 
The measures proposed by the Crisis Responding Staff and the Government change from day to day. 
For now, it seems that certain cities that represent corona hotspots will be isolated, but there are no indications that Novi Sad will be on that list. 
The situation is changing from day to day and it is ungrateful to plan and give longer-term forecasts.

Darija and Stefan are aware of the fear that exists among people due to the danger of infection. 
As postponing the wedding is seen as the last option, after consulting with family members who are top pulmonologists and in agreement with the owners of the restaurant where the wedding takes place, they took a number of measures to prevent the possible spread of COVID 19 virus among guests:

-	the guests will be kindly asked not to congratulate the newlyweds in the traditional way - by kissing - but verbally or in an another safe way
-	some of the tables with guests will be placed outdoors, depending on the prescribed measures of the Government on the allowed number of people indoors. If the allowed number is extremely small, there is enough space outside for all guests (up to 200 people) and the wedding will simply be outdoors
-	at the same table only family members and people who came together to the wedding will be placed, i.e people who see each other and socialize often in private
-	there will be a prescribed distance between the tables, i.e a safe distance
-	a disinfection barrier will be set up at the entrance to the restaurant
-	the guests will be disinfected by spraying hand sanitizer after entering the restaurant
-	the newlyweds will at their own expense provide disinfectants for each table
-	although guests will not be required to wear masks when staying indoors, those who wish can bring their own masks. A smaller number of additional masks will be provided as well
-	air circulation will be provided in a way that is in accordance with the safety recommendations

The newlyweds do not wish to endanger any of their guests in any way. Therefore, they took the above-mentioned measures to make everyone feel as comfortable and safe as possible. If, in spite of that, some people, out of fear or caution, do not want to attend the wedding festivities, that is quite understandable and justified.
All guests are kindly asked to inform the newlyweds of their decision to come to the wedding by Friday, July 3, so that the restaurant can get a confirmation of the exact number of guests on time.
