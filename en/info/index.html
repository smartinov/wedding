<p>The church wedding will be held at 2 p.m. in the Uspenska Church in Novi Sad.
The address of this church is Pozorišni trg 1.
It is located in the very center of the city, near the Serbian National Theater.</p>
<p>The newlyweds chose the Uspenska Church because of the family tradition - namely, Stefan&rsquo;s grandfather Steva and grandmother Vera got married there in the middle of the last century.
At that time, it was not frowned upon a prominent member of the SFRY army to marry in the church, so the wedding was performed in the utmost secrecy.
Grandpa Steva even answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the priest&rsquo;s question by mistake, which became a nice anecdote that was gladly retold during their seven-decade-long marriage.
Stefan and his brother Marko were baptized in the same church, so it is especially important to their family.</p>
<p>Uspenska Church is a cultural monument of exceptional importance.
A new, more beautiful and luxurious building was built on the site of an earlier modest building, in the timespan from 1765 to 1774.
It was built in the Baroque style, and due to its artistic treatment, equip.m.ent, inventory and design, it was at the time considered the most important church in Novi Sad and its surroundings.
The woodcarving and painting work were performed by Novi Sad top craftsmen and artists, and the subsequent wall painting was done by Joca Jovanović, the priest of this church.
When the church was finished, it was the most beautiful one in the city.
Its baroque tower particularly stood out.
The interior is dominated by an altar space in which the floor is lined with pink marble.
The iconostasis belongs to the group of the most developed and most meticulously carved altar partitions from the Baroque period in Serbia.
Various gilded ornaments have great artistic and craft value. Every year on the day of patron saint of the church, highly popular festivities took place in its the spacious yard.
There were graves of prominent founders around the church, and important citizens of Novi Sad or nobles were buried in its graveyard.</p>
<p>Today, this church with a rich history and tradition is a favorite among the inhabitants of Novi Sad and represents one of the symbols of Serbian Athens.</p>
